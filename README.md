Logistic analyst acts as catalyst to supply chain management
In the ever-evolving field of logistics and supply chain, transportation Management plays a critical role. To enhance decision-making and streamline operations, a robust transportation management dashboard has been developed using Excel and advanced analytical skills. 

The primary objectives of the transportation management dashboard are

• Improve Transportation Efficiency: 
• Enhance Cost Management:
• Increase Visibility/Performance Monitoring
• Facilitate Data-Driven Decisions

Key Insights

Transit Time Analysis: Identified patterns in transit times across different routes and carriers. Highlighted routes with consistently high delays and carriers with suboptimal performance.

Cost Analysis: Analyzed transportation costs by route, carrier, and shipment type. Identified high-cost routes and provided recommendations for cost reduction, such as route optimization and carrier renegotiation.

Performance Metrics: Measured delivery performance against key performance indicators (KPIs) such as on-time delivery rate, fuel efficiency, and load utilization. Provided a performance scorecard for carriers.

Route Optimization: Utilized historical data to recommend optimal routes based on factors like distance, traffic patterns, and fuel consumption. Implemented what-if analysis to compare potential savings from different routing strategies.

This Dashboard has proven to be an invaluable for optimizing logistics operations. By providing actionable insights and enabling data-driven decisions, the dashboard has significantly improved transportation efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced overall supply chain performance. This initiative underscores the importance of leveraging data analytics in modern logistics management and sets the stage for continuous improvement and innovation.
